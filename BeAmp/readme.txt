1. INTRODUCTION

Thank you for downloading this skin. Make sure you have at least Winamp 1.91 to ensure the
support of transparency. For full support check www.winamp.com for the latest release of Winamp.


2. INSTALLATION

Unzipping to your winamp/skins directory will create a subfolder storing all data. Launch Winamp, go to the option-menu and use the skin-browser to select the skin.

For users of Winamp 2.04 or higher it's enough to copy the ZIP-File to the winamp/skins
directory.


3. ABOUT

This is my second Winamp skin, the first one supporting the Winamp 2.01 specifications. I'm sure that you did not download this skin because of it's beauty. It was my intention to create a simple skin to get some practice with transparency and the new specifications. The first thing, that came in to my mind was creating a BeOS based skin. Now that my work on this is done, you can expect better skins in future.
