BeAmp v2.3 - Released November 21st 1998
   

Thank you for downloading this skin. Make sure you have at least Winamp 1.8, otherwise you
are not able to use this skin as your Winamp interface. Check www.winamp.com for the latest
release of Winamp.
 

[INSTALLATION NOTES]

Unzipping to your winamp/skins directory will create a subfolder called 'Fossil 2002' which
includes all skin data. Launch Winamp, go to the option-menu and use the skin-browser to
select the skin.

For users of Winamp 2.04 or higher it's enough to copy the ZIP-File to the winamp/skins
directory.


[NOTES]

This is my second Winamp skin. I don't believe that you downloaded that skin, because it's
looking good. It doesn't look good, but it looks like BeOS. I decided to make this one to 
get some practice with transparacy and the Winamp 2.0 specifications. Now that it's all done
you can expect better skins in future.
