BeAmp v1.0 - Released October 26th 1998
   

Thank you for downloading this skin. Make sure you have at least Winamp 1.8, otherwise you
are not able to use this skin as your Winamp interface. Check www.winamp.com for the latest
release of Winamp.
 

INSTALLATION NOTES

Unzip to your winamp/skins directory and make sure all data is kept in a subfolder. Launch
Winamp, go to the option-menu and use the skin-browser to select the skin.


NOTES

This is my second Winamp skin. For me this was just an experiment on transparency, so please
don't discuss the design of the skin, try it with someone at Be. All graphics are ripped or
reconstructed from a screenshot of some music-software on BeOS.
